      <h1>#Selfie Carbon Footprint City Index</h1>

      <h2>Federico Peliti and Rina Shumylo | CIID | April 27, 2017</h2>

      <br>

      <p>To investigate #selfie&prime;s influence on climate change, we built the algorithm to estimate #selfie CO2e emission. To find out how much energy is used per #selfie, we calculated the amount of electricity for taking several photos, editing one of them, using wireless for sharing #selfie in social media and storing it in a Data Center. We make research about quantitative #selfie data and carbon footprint of different elements of the process of taking #selfie. Combining all that data together, we made the final estimation.</p>

      <h3>Annually #selfies produce 26 000 tons of CO2e worldwide.</h3>

      <p>To make #selfie carbon footprint more tangible, we compared carbon footprint of #selfie with carbon footprint of a cup of coffee. <br>Carbon footprint of 170 #selfies  = 1 cup of coffee.</p>

      <p>We used all that data to create #Selfie Carbon Footprint City Index. An examination of cities &mdash; where most #selfies were made in one day &mdash; suggests the list of cities with worst #Selfie Carbon Footprint City Index. Top cities on the list: Makati City, Pasig, Istanbul, New York City, London, and Singapore.<br>Want to discover more cities with #Selfie Carbon Footprint City Index?
